# PSAR_selenium_testing
I previously wrote an options-trading bot that utilizes TradingView webhook alerts to trigger my bot to buy/sell options - but what criteria indicates whether it's a good time to buy or sell?

The possibilities for a such criteria are infinite. However, there are many available indicators that can be applied to stock charts in order to provide some directional bias and help determine whether one should buy or sell. For example, the widely popular Relative Strength Index (RSI) indicator aims to determine whether a stock is overbought (and therefore should be expecting a pullback in the near future) or oversold (and therefore expecting to move upwards in the near future). There are many indicators to choose from, but the one that I favor the most for my bot is the Parabolic SAR (PSAR) indicator. The PSAR indicator requires a numeric input for three different settings: Start, Increment, and Maximum. These can all be tuned individually and independently, implying that there may be an endless number of settings combinations to choose from. Tuning all of these settings in an effort to find the best possible strategy can be extremely time consuming, which is why I wrote this script to collect that data for me, using selenium.
